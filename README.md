# Graph Algorithms Visualizer

Graph-Algorithms-Visualizer is an interactive educational tool that demonstrates how fundamental graph traversal and search algorithms operate in real time.

This project provides animated, step-by-step visualizations to help students and developers better understand algorithm behavior, time complexity, and pathfinding logic.

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 Visual representation of nodes and edges
- 🔁 Step-by-step animation of algorithm execution
- 🔎 Supports multiple algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- 🎯 Path highlighting and traversal order display

## 🎓 Purpose

This project is built to make learning graph algorithms intuitive and engaging by transforming abstract concepts into visual, interactive experiences.
